## Title: Human Physical Activity Prediction Using Wearable Accelerometer Data

In this project we built a model to predict the manner in which human physical activity or movement occurs using the data collected from wearable accelerometer devices such as Jawbone, and Fit bit. First we inspected and cleansed the data starting with 160 columns, the data set was finally reduced to 60 columns. We then performed exploratory data analysis and ran correlation on the reduced data set. We also performed principal component analysis (PCA) by using singular values decomposition (SVD). These analyses helped understand independent variables in the data set that explains most of the variation in the outcome or dependent variable. Finally, we divided the data into training and cross validation (CV) sets. Then using Random Forest in caret package we built the predictive model and evaluated it against the cross validation data set to check its accuracy and out of sample error rate. Our final model exhibits an accuracy of 99.8% against the CV data. We applied our final model to the test data with 20 samples to predict the outcome with 100% correct predictions.
